## About
This is a website that displays a map of WPI's campus in the style found in the _Legend of Zelda_ nintendo switch games.

^the map from the Legend of Zelda games, also my inspiration for this project



Clicking on an icon will take you to the wpi.edu page about that building. There are a few icons on the map, each signifying a different category of building.

You can also navigate the map by using the arrow keys and zoom using the "-" and "+" keys. Trackpad controls are currently being developed, however it really sucks to do in vanilla JS...
